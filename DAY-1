## 📘 Day 1 - DSA Learning Journey

Welcome to my DSA journey! This is a log of what I learned and practiced on **Day 1**, focusing on building a strong foundation in **Arrays** and **Two Pointer** techniques.
Target: 📌 Crack DSA interviews at top product-based companies.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned

| Concept                 | Description                                                                                |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Time Complexity**     | Learned how to estimate time taken by loops. Eg: `O(n)`, `O(n²)`, dropping constants, etc. |
| **Space Complexity**    | Understood in-place updates vs extra space.                                                |
| **Two Pointer Pattern** | Used to solve problems efficiently when array is sorted or requires pairing logic.         |
| **Sliding Window**      | Learned fixed window technique for subarray/sum problems.                                  |
| **Edge Case Handling**  | Added array size checks, Integer.MIN\_VALUE checks, etc.                                   |
| **Dry Running**         | Practiced stepping through loop iterations manually to debug logic.                        |
| **Confidence Building** | Solved multiple array problems without copying — built logic from scratch.                 |

## 💡 Takeaways

* Started as a beginner — now solving medium problems with guidance
* Built understanding of two-pointer logic and sliding window patterns
* Learned importance of writing dry runs and checking edge cases
* Realized that problems repeat with **patterns**
* Motivation: I can build my logic with effort, not just by copying

---

## 🔜 Next Steps

* 📚 Finish remaining array patterns (Binary Search on Answer, Prefix Sum, etc.)
* 🧪 Solve more Two Pointer + Sliding Window problems
* 💾 Start maintaining cheat sheets per topic
* ✅ Begin Strings & Hashing from Day 2

Would you like me to generate a `Day 2 README.md` template as well when you're done with tomorrow’s practice?
give this in proper github readme code
